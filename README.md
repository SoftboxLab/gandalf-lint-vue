  <b>BAD REACT CODE SHALL NOT PASS!</b>
</h3>

## Install
Install the most powerful linter of the middle-earth (and its dependencies):

Dependencies via NPM:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @softboxlab/eslint-config-gandalf-lint-vue eslint babel-lint
```

or via yarn:
```bash
yarn add --dev @softboxlab/eslint-config-gandalf-lint-vue eslint babel-lint
```

## Configure
Call the white wizard by creating a `.eslintrc` file on your root project and writing in it:
```javascript
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:vue/recommended",
    "@softboxlab/eslint-config-gandalf-lint-vue"
  ]
}
```

Remember to add the `eslint` plugin on your favorite IDE, like this one: [ESLint for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

## Usage
If you want you can create a script on your `package.json` file like so:
```json
"scripts": {
  "glint": "./node_modules/.bin/eslint ./{YOUR_PROJECT}/*.js"
}
```

And use your magic script for shall not pass any bad code:
```bash
npm run glint
```

or using yarn:

```bash
yarn glint
```

## Autorun? Automatic lint?

**If you don't fell like creating any scripts, feel free to have your files linted on the fly by your IDE (did you remember to install the `eslint` plugin on your IDE?)**
